# gradient
2D color mixer
- give list of x-asix colors and y-axis colors and interval then mix them to generate a 2D color table.

-----


- can run the "core.pl" without setting up a web server, output to a static webpage, OR
- work interactively on server with a color picker (require spectrum.js https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum)

plans (none will happen soon):
- convert the interactive page to php -- NO plan to convert the core (yet)
- limit intervals based on color value distance
